# Simulation of plants replication and competition with other plant species

The motivation of this simulation is to observe how population of flowers or other organisms behave in a shared niche 
and how do they manage to survive when they have to compete for the same nutrients and other essentials from the same 
enviroment.


In this simulation I am portraying *Plants* on a mesh *grid*. Each plant has its own properties such as 
1. Replication coefficient
2. Agressivity
3. Visualization character

Furthermore, the prospects of given Plant rely not only on the properties of the plant kind, but also on the 
quantitative representation of individuals. In other words, the plant has better chances when it is present in the 
environment in larger numbers (so called *Clusters*).
